# How to Set Up and Run the Project

## 1. Clone the repository

First, copy the project to your computer by running this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/makeyourchoice.git
cd makeyourchoice
```

## 2. Install the required tools

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **npm** (Node's package manager)

You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## 3. Set up your environment variables

Before running the project, you need to set up a file with special settings (called **environment variables**). Follow these steps:

1. Go to the `frontend/` folder inside your project.
2. Create a file named `.env` inside that folder.
3. Open the `.env` file and add these two lines:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

You'll need to replace `your-project` and `your-supabase-anon-key` with the actual values from your Supabase account. If you don't have a Supabase account, sign up at [supabase.io](https://supabase.io/).

## 4. Run the project

Now, you're ready to start the project:

1. Go to the `frontend` folder:
```
cd makeyourchoice/frontend
```

2. Install the project dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the project with this command:
```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running and accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
