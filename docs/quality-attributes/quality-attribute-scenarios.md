## Quality

### Reliability

#### Recoverability

**Why it is important**:
- The ability to restore data in case of failures is critical for ensuring the continuity of system operations.
- It is especially important to protect the data about students' elective choices â€” this information affects the educational process and must be preserved in any situation.

**Risks if not addressed**:
- Loss of data on elective elections.
- Students may have to repeat the selection process, leading to user frustration and additional administrative overhead.

**Test**: [editCourseInfo.test.js](frontend/tests/unit/api/editCourseInfo.test.js)

Scenario (Quality Attribute Scenario format):
- Source: Admin (DoE employee)
- Stimulus: Updates information about the course, such as the title or description
- Environment: During unstable connections or after a database failure
- Artifact: database's data (from Supabase)
- Response: The system checks for the presence of an id, validates the input data, correctly updates information, or reports an error
- Response Measure: Updated data is saved without loss, or an error is thrown, preventing state corruption


#### Fault Tolerance

**Why it is important**:
- The system should remain operational despite minor faults (e.g., temporary network or database issues).
- Fault tolerance improves system robustness and user trust by minimizing downtime.

**Risks if not addressed**:
- Temporary technical issues could cause service interruptions.
- Increased burden on technical support and reduced user satisfaction.

**Test**: [archiveCourse.test.js](frontend/tests/unit/api/archiveCourse.test.js)

Scenario (Quality Attribute Scenario format):
- Source: Admin (DoE employee)
- Stimulus: Archives the course (sends it to the archive) to hide it from the student without directly deleting the course
- Environment: During a minor malfunction in Supabase (a partial failure, a temporary request error, or an unexpected exception during a network call)
- Artifact: API function [archiveCourse](frontend/src/api/functions_for_courses.js) and connection to Supabase
- Response: The system intercepts an error or exception, returns and logs the message, preventing the website from crashing
- Response Measure: The error is logged, the interface remains stable, the user receives a clear response
### Performance Efficiency

#### Capacity

**Why it is important**:
- The system must handle a high volume of requests, particularly during peak periods when 300+ students interact with it simultaneously.
- High throughput is essential for fast response times and maintaining a positive user experience.

**Risks if not addressed**:
- Potential for overload during peak usage, which could result in performance degradation or system failure.
- While exact overload risks are not fully known yet, they are expected to become significant as usage grows.

**Test**: [excelExport.test.tsx](frontend/tests/integration/excelExport.test.tsx)

Scenario (Quality Attribute Scenario format):
- Source: Admin (DoE employee)
- Stimulus: Requests the export of all student priorities data to Excel file
- Environment: During peak load (for example, the last day of elective course selection)
- Artifact: Hook [useExcelExport](frontend/src/hooks/useExcelExport.js) and related UI
- Response: The system requests data from Supabase, generates an Excel file with several sheets, and initiates the download
- Response Measure: Successful export of 1000+ lines in an acceptable time, without errors or interface freezes
