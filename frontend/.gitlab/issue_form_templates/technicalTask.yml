        Provide a clear and concise description of the technical task.
        Include any relevant context, background, or references.

        Example:

        Implement rate limiting for the API endpoints to prevent abuse.
        The rate limits should be:
        - 100 requests/minute for authenticated users
        - 30 requests/minute for unauthenticated users
        - 5 requests/second for all users (burst protection)

        Provide any technical details, considerations, or suggested approaches.
        Include links to relevant documentation or references.

        Example:

        - Use Redis for rate limiting counters
        - Follow the token bucket algorithm pattern
        - Return appropriate HTTP headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
        - Return 429 status code when limit is exceeded

        Either:
        1. Provide a checklist of subtasks (mark with [ ] for incomplete and [x] for complete)
        OR
        2. List links to sub-issues/child items that will be created to complete this task

        Example (checklist):
        - [ ] Implement Redis counter storage
        - [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
        - [ ] Add configuration for rate limits
        - [ ] Write unit tests
        - [ ] Update API documentation

        Example (sub-issues):
        - https://github.com/org/repo/issues/123
        - https://github.com/org/repo/issues/124

        Define specific, testable (pass-fail) scenarios that must be met for this task to be complete.
        Use the GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format for clarity.

        Example:
        GIVEN an unauthenticated user
        WHEN they make more than 30 requests in a minute to any API endpoint
        THEN requests beyond the limit return HTTP 429
        AND the X-RateLimit-Remaining header shows 0
